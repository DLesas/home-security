## Current Focus

1. Docker Service Management:

   - Implementation of DockerService class
   - Service discovery and validation
   - Container monitoring and control
   - Log management
   - Known issue: docker-compose.yml location management

2. Implementation Progress:
   - Basic service control (start/stop/restart)
   - Service status monitoring
   - Log streaming
   - Service validation
   - Docker health checking

## Recent Changes

1. Docker Management:

   - Added DockerService class
   - Implemented hybrid docker-compose/dockerode approach
   - Added service name validation
   - Added real-time log streaming
   - Added service health monitoring

2. Architecture Decisions:
   - Using both docker-compose and dockerode
   - Dynamic service discovery
   - Service validation
   - Container-level monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Docker Management:

   - Determine docker-compose.yml file location strategy
   - Implement file download and management
   - Add service configuration management
   - Implement backup/restore procedures
   - Add migration capabilities

2. Service Architecture:
   - Finalize service deployment strategy
   - Implement service update mechanism
   - Add service monitoring dashboard
   - Implement error recovery procedures

## Active Decisions

1. Device Monitoring:

   - Using SystemInformation for comprehensive device data
   - Stable device ordering for better UX
   - Regular polling for reliable updates
   - Error handling and recovery

2. Local-First Architecture:

   - Maintains privacy
   - Reduces latency
   - Provides offline operation

3. Service Distribution:
   - Docker-based deployment
   - Microservices architecture
   - Event-driven communication
